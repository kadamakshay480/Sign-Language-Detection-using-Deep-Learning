# Sign-Language-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of sign language gestures captured through images or videos.

Preprocessing: Standardize image sizes, adjust lighting conditions, and normalize pixel values in the dataset.

Dataset Labeling: Annotate each image or video frame with the corresponding sign language gesture.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable deep learning architecture like CNNs or RNNs for image classification or sequence modeling.

Training: Train the selected model on the annotated dataset, possibly using transfer learning for improved performance.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on a validation dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Testing: Evaluate the model's real-world effectiveness on unseen data, including new sign language gestures.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model for practical applications in assistive technologies, communication devices, or educational tools.
